                <p>
                    This was also not much of a project as it was a final assessment for my first-semester software
                    development class. For this final assessment we were asked to make a game with a partner and we were
                    given to straight weeks. In this project, my partner and I recreated a well-known game called "super
                    smash bros" and it was quite a success. I learned a lot from this project and it would overall be
                    too much to list all of it. Some example of things I learned was how to use parallel arrays, for
                    each loop, method return functions etc. I am extremely proud of this because my partner and I spent
                    a lot of time in and outside of school on it and it turned out very well.

                    <p>
                        For this project every Friday we would have an opportunity to work on whatever we wanted. For my
                        project, I decided that I wanted to learn about 3d animation. The software I used was called
                        blender
                        and I learned how to use it for 3d animation very well. Although I had great successes on this
                        project it ended in a defeat when I was unable to make the upper half of the bodywork. Although
                        it
                        failed I learned how to use a majority of the animation tools very fluently. I a very proud of
                        this
                        project because I think that blender can be very difficult to use but I was able to get the hang
                        of
                        it pretty quickly.
