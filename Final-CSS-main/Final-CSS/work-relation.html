                    <h2>Final Game Assesment</h2>
                    <p>
                        This was also not much of a project as it was a final assessment for my first-semester software
                        development class. For this final assessment we were asked to make a game with a partner and we
                        were
                        given to straight weeks. In this project, my partner and I recreated a well-known game called
                        "super
                        smash bros" and it was quite a success. I learned a lot from this project and it would overall
                        be
                        too much to list all of it. Some example of things I learned was how to use parallel arrays, for
                        each loop, method return functions etc. I am extremely proud of this because my partner and I
                        spent
                        a lot of time in and outside of school on it and it turned out very well.

                    <h2>3D Modelling Project 2</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this project every Friday we would have an opportunity to work on whatever we wanted. For my
                        project, I decided that I wanted to learn about 3d animation. The software I used was called
                        blender
                        and I learned how to use it for 3d animation very well. Although I had great successes on this
                        project it ended in a defeat when I was unable to make the upper half of the bodywork. Although
                        it
                        failed I learned how to use a majority of the animation tools very fluently. I a very proud of
                        this
                        project because I think that blender can be very difficult to use but I was able to get the hang
                        of
                        it pretty quickly.

                <h2>Lift Certificate</h2>
                <p id="lift-text">
                    This was not much of a project as it was a course. The course that I went through is very helpful to
                    students and I defiantly think that this is an important course in highschool. This course has
                    taught me a
                    lot about ethics and ethical decision-making overall. I think that I could use the skills that I've
                    learned
                    from this course to my advantage in the workplace, school, home etc. I am proud of this
                    certification
                    because it was lots of work going through this course with assignments and a final project.Â
