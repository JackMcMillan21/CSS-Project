                    <p>
                        This was also not much of a project as it was a final assessment for my first-semester software
                        development class. For this final assessment we were asked to make a game with a partner and we
                        were given two straight weeks. In this project, my partner and I recreated a well-known game
                        called "super smash bros" and it was quite a success. I learned a lot from this project and it
                        would overall be too much to list all of it. Some example of things I learned was how to use
                        parallel arrays, for each loop, method return functions etc. I am extremely proud of this
                        because my partner and I spent a lot of time in and outside of school on it and it turned out
                        very well.

                    <h2>3D Modelling Project 2</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this project every Friday we would have an opportunity to work on whatever we wanted. For my
                        project, I decided that I wanted to learn about 3d animation. The software I used was called
                        blender and I learned how to use it for 3d animation very well. Although I had great successes
                        on this project it ended in a defeat when I was unable to make the upper half of the bodywork.
                        Although it failed I learned how to use a majority of the animation tools very fluently. I am
                        very proud of this project because I think that blender can be very difficult to use but I was
                        able to get the hang of it quite quickly.

                <p id="lift-text">
                    This was not much of a project as it was a course. The course that I went through is very helpful to
                    students and I defiantly think that this is an important course in high school. This course has
                    taught me a
                    lot about ethics and ethical decision-making overall. I think that I could use the skills that I've
                    learned from this course to my advantage in the workplace, school, home etc. I am proud of this
                    certification because it was lots of work going through this course with assignments and a final
                    project.
